# CSE-212-Final-Project
Python Tutorial on Data Structures: Stack, Linked List, Tree (BST)

This is the Final Project for CSE 212 which is intended to be an introduction/tutorial on how to use three data structures of my choosing. Under the "week11" folder
are three markdown files which link to the other runable python files and images included in the folder.
PLEASE SELECT 0-welcome FIRST! This will help you navigate to the other pages in the tutorial.
